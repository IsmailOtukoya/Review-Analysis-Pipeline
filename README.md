# Review-Analysis-Pipeline
The Review Analysis Pipeline is a comprehensive project that analyzes customer reviews to gain insights into sentiment and topics. It includes modules for data cleaning, transformation, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and sentiment classification model creation. This pipeline enables efficient processing and analysis of review data .
#Modules:
Data Cleaning: The data cleaning module focuses on preprocessing the raw review data to remove noise, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information. Techniques such as text normalization, removal of special characters and numbers, and stopword removal are applied to ensure the quality and integrity of the data.

Data Transformation: In the data transformation module, the cleaned review data is transformed into a suitable format for further analysis. This may involve converting text into numerical representations, such as document-term matrices or word embeddings, to enable quantitative analysis.

Topic Modeling: The topic modeling module utilizes techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to identify latent topics within the review dataset. By extracting meaningful topics, this module provides a deeper understanding of the key themes and subjects discussed in the reviews.

Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment analysis module aims to determine the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) associated with each review. Using machine learning or natural language processing techniques, sentiment analysis helps to gauge customer opinions, sentiments, and attitudes towards specific products or services.

Sentiment Classification Model: The sentiment classification model module involves creating a machine learning model to classify reviews into sentiment categories. This module leverages labeled review data to train a model, which can then predict sentiment labels for unseen reviews. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score are used to assess the performance of the model.
